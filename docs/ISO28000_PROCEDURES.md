## Pre-Shipment Security Risk Assessment

### When to Conduct
**MANDATORY** for every shipment before container loading. Assessment must be completed 48 hours before estimated departure.

### Risk Factor Scoring (0-10 points each)

#### 1. Route Risk Score (0-10)
Evaluate shipping route for:
- **Piracy zones** (Gulf of Aden, West Africa, Southeast Asia)
- **Political instability** (conflict zones, sanctions, embargoes)
- **Weather patterns** (hurricane season, monsoons)
- **Port security** (ISPS Code compliance at ports)

**Scoring Guide:**
- 0-3: Established routes with high security (North Atlantic, Pacific North)
- 4-6: Moderate risk routes (Mediterranean, Caribbean)
- 7-8: High-risk routes (West Africa coast, Red Sea approaches)
- 9-10: Critical risk zones (active piracy areas, war zones)

#### 2. Value Risk Score (0-10)
Based on total vehicle value:
- 0-2: Vehicles under $15,000 CAD
- 3-5: Vehicles $15,000-$40,000 CAD
- 6-8: Vehicles $40,000-$100,000 CAD
- 9-10: Vehicles over $100,000 CAD (luxury/exotic)

#### 3. Destination Risk Score (0-10)
Evaluate destination country:
- **Corruption Perception Index** (Transparency International)
- **Crime rates** (vehicle theft statistics)
- **Customs complexity** (documentation requirements)
- **Political stability** (World Bank governance indicators)

**Scoring Guide:**
- 0-3: G7 countries, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore
- 4-6: Emerging markets with established law enforcement
- 7-8: Countries with elevated corruption/crime
- 9-10: High-risk destinations (State Dept. travel warnings)

#### 4. Customs Risk Score (0-10)
- 0-3: Streamlined customs (C-TPAT, AEO certified importers)
- 4-6: Standard customs procedures
- 7-8: Complex documentation requirements
- 9-10: Known for delays, inspections, or corruption

#### 5. Port Security Score (0-10)
Evaluate origin and destination port security:
- **ISPS Code compliance** (International Ship & Port Facility Security)
- **Container scanning** (X-ray, gamma ray inspection)
- **Access control** (biometric, badge systems)
- **Surveillance** (CCTV coverage, guard patrols)

**Scoring Guide:**
- 0-3: Top-tier ports (Rotterdam, Singapore, Los Angeles, Vancouver)
- 4-6: Standard security ports
- 7-8: Limited security infrastructure
- 9-10: Known security concerns, theft incidents

### Risk Score Calculation
```
Total Risk Score = Route (0-10) + Value (0-10) + Destination (0-10) + 
                   Customs (0-10) + Port Security (0-10)

Risk Score Range: 0-50 points (converted to 0-100 scale by doubling)
```

### Risk Classification
- **Low Risk (0-30)**: Standard insurance, basic security
- **Medium Risk (31-60)**: Enhanced security, seal verification
- **High Risk (61-85)**: Lloyd's Register monitoring recommended, premium insurance
- **Critical Risk (86-100)**: Lloyd's Register surveyor mandatory, armed escort consideration

### Mitigation Measures

- ISO 6346 compliant container
- VVTT (Vehicle Verification Tracking Tag)
- Basic seal (bolt seal)
- Standard insurance (vehicle value)

#### Medium Risk Mitigation
- ISO 6346 container + inspection at origin
- High-security bolt seal (ISO 17712)
- Origin port seal verification by independent surveyor
- Insurance at 110% vehicle value

#### High Risk Mitigation

- Origin inspection by LR surveyor (seal application witnessed)
- GPS-enabled seal or container tracking device
- Insurance at 125% vehicle value
- Destination inspection by LR surveyor

#### Critical Risk Mitigation

## Container Seal Application Procedures

### Seal Types & Standards

#### ISO 17712 High-Security Seal Requirements
All shipments must use ISO 17712 compliant seals:
- **Unique identifier** (alpha-numeric, min 8 characters)
- **Tamper-evident** design (cannot be removed without visible damage)
- **Strength rating** (500kg breaking force minimum)
- **ISO certification** mark on seal body

#### Approved Seal Suppliers
1. **EJ Brooks Company** (ISO 17712 certified bolt seals)
2. **American Casting & Manufacturing** (cable seals)
3. **Mega Fortris** (electronic seals with GPS)

### Seal Application Process

#### Step 1: Pre-Sealing Inspection (20 minutes before loading)
1. Inspect container for damage, prior tampering
2. Document container number (ISO 6346 format: ABCD1234567)
3. Photograph container exterior (all 4 sides + doors)
4. Check seal integrity (new, undamaged)

#### Step 2: Vehicle Loading
1. Load vehicle(s) into container
2. Secure vehicle with ISO 6208 compliant lashing (wheel chocks, straps)
3. Photograph vehicle inside container
4. Close container doors (verify locking mechanism engaged)

#### Step 3: Seal Application
1. **Person Applying Seal**: Record name, company, date/time
2. Thread seal through door locking mechanism
3. Close seal until audible "click" or lock confirmation
4. **Record seal number** in shipment system immediately
5. Photograph sealed container doors (close-up of seal + wide shot)

#### Step 4: Origin Port Verification (if required)
For Medium/High/Critical risk shipments:
1. Independent surveyor inspects seal application
2. Surveyor verifies seal number matches documentation
3. Surveyor signs PortVerification record
4. Photo evidence uploaded to shipment record

### Seal Verification at Destination

#### Standard Procedure
Upon arrival at destination port:
1. **Destination agent** or **Lloyd's Register surveyor** inspects seal
2. Photograph seal before removal
3. Verify seal number matches shipping documentation
4. Check seal for tampering (scratches, damage, misalignment)
5. Record seal condition: "INTACT" or "COMPROMISED"
6. If compromised: DO NOT open container, notify authorities

#### Compromised Seal Protocol
If seal shows evidence of tampering:
1. **STOP** - Do not open container
2. Notify local police/customs immediately
3. Photograph seal damage from multiple angles
4. Create SecurityIncident record (incident_type='seal_tampering')
5. Lloyd's Register incident hotline: +44 20 7709 9166
6. Insurance notification within 24 hours
7. Full container inspection by authorities before release

from shipments.lloyd_register_service import LloydRegisterService

# Register shipment with Lloyd's Register
lr_service = LloydRegisterService()
result = lr_service.register_shipment(
    shipment_id=shipment.id,
    service_level='premium',  # standard, premium, or surveyor
    route={
        'origin_port': 'Vancouver, BC',
        'destination_port': 'Mombasa, Kenya',
        'transit_ports': ['Singapore']
    },
    cargo={
        'description': '2020 Toyota Camry',
        'value_cad': 25000,
        'vin': '4T1B11HK1KU123456'
    }
)

# Returns: {'tracking_id': 'LR-2024-1234567', 'status': 'registered'}
```

#### Step 2: Surveyor Scheduling
For Premium/Surveyor service levels:
1. Call `request_origin_inspection(shipment_id)` 48 hours before loading
2. LR assigns local surveyor (typically from SGS, Bureau Veritas network)
3. Surveyor contacts shipper to schedule inspection

#### Step 3: Monitoring & Status Updates
```python
# Check shipment status
status = lr_service.get_verification_status(shipment.lloyd_register_tracking_id)
# Returns: {
#   'origin_inspection': 'completed',
#   'destination_inspection': 'pending',
#   'seal_status': 'verified_intact',
#   'incidents': []
# }
```

#### Step 4: Certificate Retrieval
Upon successful delivery:
```python
# Download Certificate of Safe Delivery (PDF)
cert_url = lr_service.get_certificate(shipment.lloyd_register_tracking_id)
# Returns: 'https://lr.org/certificates/LR-2024-1234567.pdf'
```

### Incident Reporting to Lloyd's Register
